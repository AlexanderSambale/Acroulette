### Audio recording

We need access to realtime audio recording data for speech recognition.
The recording is processed live and only used to **recognize command words**
by which you can control the app.
After **a couple of seconds** when the command is recognized or no command was recognized, the recording will be deleted.
If you say for example "new position"
the app can change state and display a random position.
There is **no data transfer** to a server or third party.
We use **privacy friendly offline** models for voice recognition called Vosk speech recognition.
