### Audio recording

We need access to realtime audio recording data for speech recognition.

The recording is **continuous**, when you touch the *play* button and stops if you press the *stop* button. It will only be used to **recognize command words**
by which you can control the app.

The recording of **a couple of seconds** is buffered and deleted when words are recognized or no words were recognized.

If you say for example "new position" with default settings
the app can change state and display and announce a random position.

There is **no data transfer** to a server or third party.

We use **privacy friendly offline models** for voice recognition called Vosk.
